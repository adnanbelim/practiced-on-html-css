            <h3>Something as simple as bringing a child inside, offering them a cold drink, and having them rest can
                make a
                difference. Some of these models can also make deliciously frothy hot chocolate, tea, or cold drinks. If
                you
                were family and you got past his gate, he’d warmly tell you, “Well, come on in and have a cold drink,
                have a
                Pepsi.” Most concession stands remain shuttered, though a few are open offering Bento boxes and instant
                ramen and cold drinks for the benefit of the press and other attendees.</h3>

            <h1>History of drinks</h1>
            <h3>
                <p>The first marketed soft drinks appeared in the 17th century as a mixture of water and lemon juice
                    sweetened with honey. In 1676 the Compagnie de Limonadiers was formed in Paris and granted a
                    monopoly
                    for the sale of its products. Vendors carried tanks on their backs from which they dispensed cups of
                    lemonade.</p>

                <p> Carbonated beverages and waters were developed from European attempts in the 17th century to imitate
                    the
                    popular and naturally effervescent waters of famous springs, with primary interest in their reputed
                    therapeutic values. The effervescent feature of the waters was recognized early as most important.
                    Flemish scientist Jan Baptista van Helmont first used the term gas in his reference to the carbon
                    dioxide content. French physician Gabriel Venel referred to aerated water, confusing the gas with
                    ordinary air. British scientist Joseph Black named the gaseous constituent fixed air.</p>

                <p>Robert Boyle, an Anglo-Irish philosopher and scientist who helped found modern chemistry, published
                    his
                    Short Memoirs for the Natural Experimental History of Mineral Waters in 1685. It included sections
                    on
                    examining mineral springs, on the properties of the water, on its effects upon the human body, and,
                    lastly, “of the imitation of natural medicinal waters by chymical and other artificial wayes.”</p>
